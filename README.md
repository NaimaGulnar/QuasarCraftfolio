# CraftFolio

CraftFolio is a portfolio generator app, which allows users to create a professional portfolio by inputting personal details, skills, and projects, and then downloading the generated portfolio as an HTML file.

## How it works

- **Form Input:** Users fill out a step-by-step form where they can add personal information, skills, and projects they want to showcase in their portfolio.
- **Download Portfolio:** After filling out the form, users can click the "Download" button to generate and download their portfolio as an HTML file.
- **Demo Data:** To make the process easier, you can use the "demoData.txt" file with pre-filled data. Simply copy and paste the demo data into the form, then modify any specific details as needed before downloading your portfolio.
