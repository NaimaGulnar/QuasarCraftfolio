# CraftFolio

CraftFolio is a portfolio generator app, which allows users to create a professional portfolio by inputting personal details, skills, and projects, and then downloading the generated portfolio as an HTML file. 

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Provides a form to input personal details, skills, and projects.
- **Download Portfolio:** Once the details are entered, users can download their portfolio as a clean HTML file.
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully responsive design, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Styling:** Built with modern UI components provided by Quasar.

## How it works

- **Form Input:** Users fill out a step-by-step form where they can add personal information, skills, and projects they want to showcase in their portfolio.
- **Download Portfolio:** After filling out the form, users can click the "Download" button to generate and download their portfolio as an HTML file.
